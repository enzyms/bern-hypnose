So, what if I told you that most local
businesses are doing SEO completely
wrong? You're obsessing over writing
blogs about how to unclog a sink and
sourcing hundreds of backlinks while
your competitors are building entity
relevance for plumber Houston and
they're stealing every single local
lead. In this video, you're going to
learn the exact twoe local SEO system
that I've used to rank over 200 local
businesses in the top three of Google
Maps. The same system that's built my
sevenfigure agency over the past 10
years. So to start, I'm going to tell
you why your website exists is for one
purpose and one purpose only. And it's
not what you think. So let me show you
with a real client example. And I'm
going to reveal the single biggest
mistake they made that cost them
thousands in wasted traffic. I had a
Lasic eye surgery center in downtown
Chicago reach out to me. They're getting
over 80,000 monthly visits from Google
search. Sounds amazing, right? Wrong.
Almost none of those visitors were
local. They were following conventional
SEO wisdom. They were writing blogs,
building backlinks, getting traffic, but
not the traffic they wanted. Here is
what their local rank position looked
like for their target keyword before
they hired my agency. You see all those
spots with positions four or higher? For
local SEO, position four is the first
position on the second page. You may as
well be invisible. Now, there's plenty
of ranking out in Lake Michigan for some
reason, and a tiny bit very close to
their address, but nothing in the
neighborhoods where their customers
actually lived. Now, here's what that
local ranking map looks like after we
restructured their website using the
system I'm going to share with you.
Green dots everywhere. A dramatic
improvement in local rankings. and more
importantly, a massive increase in calls
from actual potential customers in
Chicago. So, what was that one mistake
they were making? I'll show you exactly
what it was and how we fixed it in just
2 weeks. But first, let me talk about a
plumber with 12 reviews outranking
plumbers with over 3,000. If reviews
don't get you ranked, what does? And to
understand this, we need to know what
your website is actually for. So, here's
what most people get wrong from day one.
They think their website needs to rank.
That's not how local SEO works. Your
website exists for one reason, to help
your Google business profile rank
higher. That's it. Every single URL on
your local business website exists to
boost your GBP rankings, not to rank
themselves, not to collect blog traffic.
They're there to help your GBP show up
in the top three map pack positions
farther and farther away from your GBP
address. Because when someone searches
for a local service, Google shows a map
with three business listings. Those are
the Google business profiles, not the
websites. And 60 to 70% of clicks go to
those top three. If you're not in the
top three, you're invisible. So, how do
you get your GBP into those top three
positions? First thing, and this is
where most local businesses make a
massive mistake, they choose one primary
category and call it a day. But Google
allows you to choose up to 10
categories. If you're only using one,
you're leaving money on the table.
Target at least three to five categories
on your GBP, but they all need to be
relevant to your primary category. I'd
rather have you have fewer than adding
non-relevant categories. So, if you're a
plumber, you would probably add drainage
service, gas installation service, and
septic tank service as secondary
categories. Next, list at least 20 to 30
services on your GBP. Most local
businesses have zero or just a handful.
By listing 30 or even more, you're
telling Google exactly what you do and
for what searches they should show your
business. Now, if you don't know which
services to add, I'm going to show you
an AI prompt that's going to help you
come up with more ideas that are
semantically relevant to your
categories. Once you've added these
services, I want you to go and fill out
absolutely every single box in your GBP.
Every single box, your business
description, the services, the Q&A, the
post, the everything. And speaking of
posts, you should regularly be posting
on the GBP at least once a week. You can
schedule 52 posts to go live once a
week. and you'll be done for the entire
year. I have the exact AI prompt that
generates all 52 in one shot. It'll save
you about 10 hours of work. It's in my
school community. There's a link to that
in the description. If you don't want to
join, no problem. I'm going to show you
the prompt on screen. Just freeze frame
and you can use it. Now, the last thing,
you also want to make sure you have 20
or 30 photos on your GBP and add a new
photo every week. Now, we geo tag all
the photos that we add because we've
seen better results when we geoteag
photos. With all of these steps
combined, the entire process of
optimizing your GBP should take you less
than an hour, including getting the 52
posts and a bunch of photos scheduled.
And this step alone will put you ahead
of 90% of your local competition. And
the best part, this is pure systems
work. No cold calling, no pitching, no
networking events, just you, the system,
and results you can show clients. But
here's where that LASIC center was
absolutely blowing it and where most
local businesses completely missed the
mark. Their GBP was optimized, sure, but
their website was working against them.
They had all this content, but it was
the wrong content for local SEO. So many
local businesses hire SEO experts who
post a blog every single week for years.
And sure, if you're consistent and you
source quality links, this can work for
organic traffic, but it rarely generates
actual local traffic to your Google
business profile. Remember when I said
every single URL exists to rank your
Google business profile? Here's why the
blog method doesn't work. Blogs target
keywords that don't have a map pack.
It's as simple as that. There's also
something really deep going on here that
a lot of SEO agencies don't fully
understand. Okay, let's rewind a bit. In
2017, Google invented the transformer
technology, the same tech that now
powers chat GPT. The T in chat GPT
stands for transformer. This
fundamentally changed how search works.
Before transformers, Google was
basically matching keywords. You write
plumber Houston if you had the right
backlinks and you might start ranking
for it. But transformers gave Google the
ability to understand entities and the
relationship between different entities.
An entity isn't a keyword. It's a thing
that Google's algorithm recognizes and
understands. Joe's plumbing is an
entity. Houston is an entity. Plumber is
an entity. And Google now understands
how these entities relate to one
another. An easy way to think about it,
if the word river and bank both appear
in the same sentence, Google knows that
that bank isn't talking about money.
This is the same breakthrough that made
chat GPT possible. The ability to
understand context and relationships,
not just match words. So, what does this
mean for you? The goal with your website
content is to build entity relevance.
You need to convince Google that your
business entity is relevant to the
plumber entity and to the Houston entity
and that these relationships are very
very strong. An article about top five
ways to unclog a sink does not build
entity relevance for plumber Houston. It
might get you some traffic for people
searching DIY plumbing projects, but it
will not help your Google business
profile rank higher in your local
market. Google sees that content and
thinks plumbing advice blog, not plumber
in Houston. This was the LASIC cent's
mistake. They had all this educational
content about eye health, lasic
procedures, recovery tips. It was all
great content. Google saw them as a
reasonable competitor to WebMD, but none
of it was building entity relevance for
Lasic Surgeon Chicago. They were an
educational resource in Google's eyes,
not a local service provider. We need to
build a website structure that creates
both topical and geographical relevance
to rank your GBP. Now, topical relevance
convinces Google that you actually do
that service. Geographical relevance
convinces Google that you do that
service in that location. And we're not
building geographical relevance just for
Houston. We're building it for the
specific part of the northern
neighborhood of River Oaks, for West
Montros, for the Heights, specific
neighborhoods, specific landmarks near
where your customers actually live.
Okay, so start with your homepage. It
should target the exact keyword phrase,
primary GBP category, and city name.
This is how we build entity relevance.
For example, plumber Houston. Now, this
exact phrase should be in your title
tag. It should be in your H1 tag and it
should be addressed immediately in the
first sentence or two of your content.
Now, I analyzed over a 100 local
business websites a couple months ago
and guess what? The most common homepage
title tag was the word home. That's it,
just home. Over 60% of local business
websites had either home or their
business name as the title tag. Home is,
of course, the default title tag on many
website builders. They simply never
bothered to update it. Your competitors
are making it very easy for you to
outrank them. A roofer in Kansas City
was struggling to rank. So I checked
their website. Their title tag was
welcome. Not whole, but pretty close. We
changed it to include roof replacement
Kansas City. And within 2 weeks, they
jumped from position 4.75 to position
2.03 in the map pack. That simple change
along with the other simple
optimizations here in this video doubled
their calls. Now, here's how you
structure the rest of the site to build
that entity relevance. On your homepage,
use each of the secondary GBP categories
as H2 tags. Under each H2 tag, write 50
to 100 words about that secondary
category. Then, create a new detailed
page for each secondary category. Your
target keyword for each one is the
secondary category city name. For
example, drainage service Houston. Then
link to those pages from those little
blurbs of text below the relevant H2s.
Here's what this does. You're not just
telling Google you're a plumber. You're
showing them that you're an authority on
drainage service, gas installation, all
in Houston. You're building
comprehensive topical coverage. Add a
link from each homepage paragraph to its
corresponding detail page. This creates
additional relevance, telling Google
exactly what each page is about through
the context around that link. Google
cares about a lot more than just anchor
text these days. Now, on each one of
those secondary category pages, grab the
most relevant services from your GBP.
Use each service as an H2 and write 50
to 100 words about that service. Then
create individual pages for every single
service. Water heater installation
Houston, Drain Cleaning Houston,
Emergency Plumber Houston. Now, here's
where most agencies stop and lose. Every
single one of those services needs its
own page. This is how you become an
entity fortress instead of just another
plumbing website. When you're done,
you're going to have around 30 pages on
your local website. One for every
category and one for every service. I
call this the core 30. We did exactly
this for a Plano plumber. 30 pages in a
couple of weeks. They had 425 new calls
across their service area as their
ranking went from 17 to 2 and 1/2. Now,
think about this from Google's
perspective. Your competitors are
writing top five plumbing tips. You're
building comprehensive coverage of every
service you offer in every format Google
expects, all tied to your exact
location. Which of those do you think
Google is going to trust more? Every
single page is going to use the target
city name, and together they're giving
Google a massive amount of relevance,
comprehensiveness, and authority. This
is how you build trust with Google's
algorithm, which after all is just math.
Now, you're probably thinking, "30 pages
of content sounds like months of work."
Well, you're probably already using AI
to generate content. If you're not, I
mean, it's late 2025. You really should
be. But here's how to generate content
with AI the right way for local SEO. Let
me give you my exact single prompt for
local SEO content. Again, you can
literally pause it and copy it and use
it today, or you can jump to my school
community. There's a link in the
description and grab the prompt there.
But here's what separates content that
ranks from content that doesn't. You
need to edit what AI gives you. Add
personal touches. Make sure everything
reads naturally. Include actual client
stories, local neighborhood mentions,
specific local events. This is what
makes your content different from
everyone else who's just using AI. Even
if you're using a better prompt, the AI
is going to give you the structure and
90% of the writing. You're going to go
in there and give it some local flavor,
real world experience that makes someone
reading it think this person knows what
they're talking about. When you do this
right, you're going to create content
that builds entity relevance for your
primary category and for your city.
Every single page is reinforcing to
Google's algorithm that you are a
plumber in Houston or an HVAC contractor
in Dallas or whatever your business and
location happens to be. Now, we had an
HBAC client in Washington DC. They've
been trying to rank for years with
blogging. They had three or 400 indexed
URLs when we came in. After implementing
this exact structure, they went from
position 7 to position two in just a
month. And yes, we cranked out a lot of
content and edited existing content to
make that site structure happen in just
the first month. Even with 30 pages of
perfectly optimized, locally relevant
content, Google still needs one more
thing before they'll rank you high.
Here's what Google's thinking when they
see all of your new content. Well, I
mean, okay, not really thinking, though,
right? I mean, I don't want to make
Google seem like it's a person. It
really is just math. We really need a
better word than thinking. But, okay, I
digress. Here's what Google's thinking.
This website just added 30 pages of
content. Is this real? Is this valuable?
Or is this just AI generated slop?
Google needs external validation. They
need other websites to vouch for your
content. In fact, Google became the
trillion dollar company that it is today
because the founders had one simple
idea. Quality websites don't link to
spam or slop. So, if quality sites are
linking to you, you'll rank better. That
is the entire foundation of Google's
algorithm. You can actually still read
the original Stanford PhD written in 1999. Now, what this means is you need
to source external links to each URL you
created. These links act as votes of
confidence that tell Google your content
is valuable. When Google's algorithm
sees quality websites linking to your
pages, it immediately increases the
perceived value of your content. And
this is especially important when you're
using AI to generate content faster. For
local businesses, you don't need
hundreds of links. Strategic highquality
local links will do more for you than
countless low-quality links. The
absolute number one best and easiest to
get link for local businesses, your
local chamber of commerce. Now, the
Chamber of Commerce link is usually
going to cost you based on how many
employees you have, between $2 $300 per
year in most cities. But that single
link is going to provide more local
authority than almost anything else you
can do. Google recognizes chambers of
commerce as local authority sites. If
you can join multiple chambers in your
region within 70 miles or so, even
better. I once ranked a personal injury
attorney in New Orleans by joining a
dozen or so chambers of commerce. Each
one adds another layer of local
validation to your site. Beyond chambers
of commerce, look for local sponsorship
opportunities, youth sports teams,
community events, local charities. These
links not only help your SEO, but they
also build genuine community
connections. Let me show you a prompt
that we use with ChatGpt or Claude to
find these local organizations. Again,
you can grab it in the link in the
description. For a new local website,
even just 5 to 10 quality local links
across your site can make a dramatic
difference in rankings. Now, you're
probably wondering, how fast can this
actually work? Because a lot of SEO
agencies will tell you it takes 6 months
to see results. Let me show you the
exact twoe timeline we use. So week one,
first three days, access the GBP, audit
it, and optimize it. Sometimes it takes
time to get access to everything, but
once you get access to the site and the
GBP, we're going to start with the audit
and optimization. Add the categories,
add the services, fill out every box,
schedule 52 weekly posts, schedule a
bunch of photos. This should take less
than an hour with AI's help. After that,
days four to seven, finishing out that
first week, audit and optimize the GBP
landing page. Usually, this is the
homepage. Make sure the primary category
and city name are in the title tag in
H1. Get a GBP embed on the page. Make
sure the local business schema is set up
correctly. And make sure the secondary
categories and core services are at
least mentioned on the homepage, ideally
as H2 tags. This is your foundation.
Okay, moving on into week two, days 8
through 10. This is content creation.
Here's where we're going to use AI to
generate content for all the pages
following the structure we discussed.
Review each page, add personal touches,
and make sure everything reads
naturally. Focus on optimizing title
tags, H1's, H2s, and the internal
linking structure. Don't worry too too
much about the content overall.
Remember, very few people are going to
be reading this. It is to build
relevance with Google's algorithm. But
make sure you add images. Client images
are best, but AI ones also work. If you
don't have any images, Google's going to
ignore the content. Okay. Days 11
through 12, external validation. Join
your local chambers of commerce. Set up
citations. Begin acquiring additional
local links. Submit your site map to
Google Search Console so Google knows
about all of your new pages. Days 13 and
14, finishing up week two, technical
optimization. Here's where we're going
to add schema markup to the website in
addition to the local business schema
we've already looked at on your
homepage. Google has a free testing tool
for this. You're going to optimize
images, check mobile responsiveness, and
make sure the site loads quickly. If you
want this complete day-by-day checklist
with every single step broken down,
that's in the school community. And that
way, you're not trying to remember
things from this video. By day 14, 2
weeks in, Google should have crawled
your new site structure, indexed your
new content, and recognized the external
validation factors. That's when you'll
usually start to see movement in
rankings. This is how I built my agency
to seven figures without being a sales
guy. I built systems that delivered
results and the results sell themselves.
But let me set realistic expectations
here about different market sizes. In
markets with under 200 300,000 people,
you're going to often see movement into
the top three within just a couple of
weeks following this system. And within
30 days, that top three ranking is going
to extend farther and farther from your
GBP address, covering more neighborhoods
where your customers actually live. For
larger markets, 400 500,000 and above,
it of course is going to take longer to
reach the top three. They're more
competitive, and you'll probably need
more content and more external
validation. But you'll still see
significant movement within those first
two weeks. The key is that this system
works because most of your competitors
aren't doing it right. They're focused
on the wrong metrics or using outdated
strategies. They're writing blog posts
about five ways to unclog a drain.
Instead of building entity relevance for
their primary category and location,
when you implement this complete system,
you're playing a different game than
they are. The game that Google wants you
to be playing. We don't need to use
black hat tricks or ranking hacks. I've
personally used this system to rank
local businesses in over 50 different
markets. From small towns to major
cities with a success rate above 90%,
even in competitive markets like
downtown Chicago, we've gotten
businesses into the top three by
following this exact blueprint. And
remember that LASIC center I mentioned
at the beginning, the one in downtown
Chicago, they were getting 80,000 visits
from Google, but barely any local
customers. After implementing the
system, their local rank map went from
almost no green except for Lake Michigan
to green dots everywhere. Dramatic
improvement in local rankings and of
course, more importantly, a massive
increase in calls from actual potential
customers in Chicago. That's the power
of building topical and geographical
relevance the right way. It's the power
of understanding your website exists to
rank your Google business profile, not
to collect random blog traffic. You
don't need to be the most charismatic
agency owner. You need to be the one who
actually gets clients results while
everyone else is writing blog posts. So,
there's the exact local SEO system
that's ranked 200 or more businesses in
the top three of Google Maps in just a
few weeks. Your website exists to boost
your Google business profile, not to
collect blog traffic. But while you're
implementing this, your competitors are
capturing traffic from Google's AI
overview. They're showing up in AI
generated answers while you're fighting
for traditional map pack spots. Now, map
pack searches have 10 or 100 times the
volume of chat GPT search, but we still
want to be aware of where you are in
chat GPT and in Google's AI overview.
So, that's why I created a complete
strategy for dominating Google's AI
overviews, even if you're on page two.
I'll show you how to get featured in the
AI overview and capture traffic your
competitors frankly don't even know
exists. So, click the video on your
screen. This is what separates
businesses from getting some local
traffic from those dominating every
single local search.
